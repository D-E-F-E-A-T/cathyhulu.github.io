        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 26 Mar - 1 Apr Mar Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my tenth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>Not much happened this week other than my gov exam and the Darwin project. So far, I feel pretty confident on both items: didn’t think the gov exam was that bad and the Darwin project is going pretty well. One interesting thing this week was the recent extra credit talk on Monday. I like how the speaker spoke more about life and career issues, such as negotiating for your salary than the general news or issues about the tech industry or specific company.  Not that there is nothing wrong listening to recent industry news, but it is nice to have a break once in awhile and listen to other topics. 

        </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>Next week seems like a big one for me. I have two exams, algo and religious studies. Luckily, the religious studies exam shouldn’t be too bad. Then for some of my orgs, all the big events and competitions are next week. Then to top it off, the Darwin project is due next Thursday. (Tears ;-;) Hopefully if I get most of my homework done today, next week won’t be too bad. Oh wait, tomorrow is Wholesome Hacks...</p>
        <p>
        Ok, if I finish all homework and assignments and projects tonight, then I think I can survive next week. (Double Tears;-; ;-;)
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>Given the stuff that needs to get done, I guess I will take it one day at a time. Thus, this weekend I will start off with doing Wholesome Hacks and studying for the algo exam. After Monday, I can then focus on finishing Darwin, studying for religious studies, and doing my officer tasks. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>So far the class has been a bit confusing, especially with the different types of constructor. But the Darwin assignment has been interesting. 
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick-of-the-week is Lynda.com. A good thing about going to University of Texas at Austin is that get a free subscription to Lynda for free. Which means you get a ton of courses, from Photoshop to cloud computing, for no cost. I’m happy that my friend told me about this amazing benefit early on in my college career, because the subscription ends when you graduated. Hopefully, you will find this website as useful as I do.
