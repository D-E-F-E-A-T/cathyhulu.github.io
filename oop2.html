        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
	      <h3>Week of 22 Jan - 28 Jan Post 1</h3>
	      <p>Here's my second blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>This week started off strong, began the Collatz project and finished my gov homework. 
           However on Tuesday, I seem to have caught a terrible cold. 
           Thus, many of my assignments and homework had to be put on hold, while I try to recover. 
           According to the Internet, a cold should go away within a week. 
           So hopefully by Monday, I feel better, because trying to code while sick is terrible. 
        </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>Unlike previous semesters, it seems this one has more readings and quizzes, which I'm still getting used to. 
           Another big thing is finishing Collatz and my algorithms homework. 
           Hopefully, I can finish those assignment before the big due dates. 
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>For next week, my main priority will be to get better as soon as possible, either by eating more fruit or resting more. 
          With the big Collatz project due soon, I want to try and finish it on Wednesday.
          That way, I can spend all of Thursday double-checking my code and the
          workflow requirements.
          Besides Collatz, I still need to finish my algorithms homework and 
          my competitive programming assignment. 
          With competitive, the assignment is longer and harder than the last one, so I need to start on that one earlier.  

        </p>
        <h4>4.) Whatâ€™s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>So far the lectures have been very informative, talking about 
          optimizations for Collatz and the difference between post-increment 
          and pre-increment. 
          Downing does a great job keeping you engage. 

        <p>
        <h4> 5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick of the week is Termux, which is a terminal emulator on Android.
           I found it really cool that one can create and run programs on their phone. 
           Though last time I tried to mess with my phone, I somehow disabled screen rotation indefinitely. 
           So now my phone will not rotate the screen unless you're playing a fullscreen
           Youtube video. In that case, it will remain stuck in horizontal mode until you
           leave for the home menu.
           Although I don't build apps with the app, I do use Termux to ssh into the lab machines, which contains most of my school assignments.  
           I found this really convenient, especially when you want quickly check, run, or edit your code.
