        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Final Entry </h3>
        <h4>1.) What did you like the least about the class? </h4>
        <p>My least favorite thing about the class was the lecture style themselves. As a visual learner, I found it really hard to listen and understand the material. Since Downing mostly verbally talks during the lecture, I often felt lost. Personally, I would like some text of what he says or what we’re currently talking about. Like being able to see the actually words would be very helpful.  </p>

        <h4>2.) What did you like the most about the class?
</h4>
        <p>I liked the in-class HackerRank exercises. Not only were they good practices for the exams, but were extremely helpful in understanding the material. They kind of bridge the gap between learning the concepts and applying them. I would like to see more these exercises in the future. </p>

        <h4>3.) What's the most significant thing you learned?</h4>
        <p>How to code in C++! Before this semester, I only had little espouse to the language. This class really helped in learning all the little details of the language, as well as comparing it to other programming languages.  </p>

        <h4>4.) How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class? </h4>
        <p>Though some weeks was heavier than others, I would say the most I spent was 10 hours. Most of the time was spent debugging Travis-CI or writing tests cases. The actually code itself didn’t take too long.</p>

        <h4>5.) How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
 </h4>
        <p>I’m a really slow reader, so my times might differ from others’. I would say I spent about 5 hours at the beginning of the semester. Eventually, I kind of stop doing the readings as the quizzes stopped testing them. Kind of ashamed, because the readings is where you really get to learn OOP concepts, since the lectures focus on C++. </p>

        <h4>6.) How many lines of code do you think you wrote? </h4>
        <p>I admit I do not know how many lines of code I wrote. Maybe somewhere in the hundreds. </p>
        <h4>7.) What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
</h4>
        <p>The continuous integration tool, Travis-CI. It was cool that you did not need the testing environment, since the tool already has it for you. It would cool to see how this tool is used in larger scale projects, ones with multiple people working on it. </p>

        <h4>8.) If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
</h4>
        <p>I would do more HackerRank exercise. I felt I would have done better on the second exam, if we did more of them in class. Another thing I would add is writing down what we’re talking about during the lectures.
