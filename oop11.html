        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 2 Apr - 8 Apr Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my eleventh blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>This week was a bit busy. I had a algo exam, religious studies exam, and the OOP project. The algo exam and OOP project was quite rough. Thankfully, the religious studies exam was better, only had a few tricky questions. Yeah, the majority of my week was spent on studying or working on assignments. </p>

        <p>Though one silly incident did happen (I guess). On Thursday, I had a scheduled phone interview. When the time came, my phone didn’t ring at all, so I thought the interviewer must have forgot about me. After 30 minutes of waiting, I sent them an email about rescheduling. Thinking back, I should have call them 5-10 minutes after the scheduled time, but I didn’t. Then Friday morning, the interviewer emailed me back. Turns out, she did call me but my phone didn’t pick up her calls. She then asked if I can do an interview today at 10am. Sadly, I woke up at 10:20. So now, we’re trying to schedule an interview for next week.  Hopefully, things will go well. </p>

        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>Nothing major is happening in school next week. A nice break from the hectic two weeks I had before. Still, have to finish my weekly reading assignments for my class. </p>

        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>This weekend and next week I plan to practice my interview answers. I haven’t been able to do much after spring break. So I really to some preparation this weekend. Thankfully, there’s isn’t much schoolwork to do, so I can really focus on interview prep. Other than that, I need to finish readings for my religious studies and government class. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>The material in this class has been interesting and tricky. To keep up, I think I should try studying and reviewing the material everyday.  
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My tip-of-the-week is to call you interviewer if it has been maybe 5-10 minutes after the schedule time. Because either they might have forgot or your phone doesn’t like accepting calls at the moment. On Thursday, I didn’t do it as I thought it was rude, especially if the interviewer says they will call you themselves.
