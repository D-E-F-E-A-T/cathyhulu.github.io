            <h4>1.) What are your expectations of the class? </h4>
        <p>From this course, I expect to learn about C++, including all the little details of the language.
           Besides C++, I think Downing will also teach about important industy tools, like Docker. 
           Hopefully by the end of this class, I can become proficient in both the language and tools. 
           From what my friends speak about Downing, praising him for his teaching skills, I believe I can achieve my goals for this semester.
        </p>
        <h4>2.) What do you think of this week?</h4>
        <p>As far as first weeks go, I think this one went pretty well. 
           We went over the syllbus and began an introduction on C++. 
           I liked how Downing pointed out key differences between C++ and Java. It really helps in differentiating between the two languages.
           Then on Friday's class, we learned about the Collatz Conjecture, which certainly fascinated me.
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What's in your way? </h4>
        <p>Last semester, I took CS 439 Operating Systems, which destroyed me. 
           Often I didn't have much time to pursue my hobbies or work on sideprojects. 
           So this semester, I will be working on to relive my favorite activities or dusting off some forgotten code. 
           Besides that and my classes, I expect this semester to be quite relaxed compared to the fall. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>Next week, I will start doing readings for all four of classes: algorithms, OOP, government, and history. 
           Sadly, I am a slow reader, so hopefully I can keep up. 
           For OOP specifically, I anticipate the first project will be released, so I will definitely be working on that. 
           If not, I still need to do my first competitive programming assignment, which seems quite tricky.
           Then there's the daily quizes in OOP and government I need to review for. 
           So far, the second week of class looks like a pretty standard college week. 
           I guess this means my winter break is truly over.  </p>
          <h4>5.) Whatâ€™s my experience of the class? </h4>
          <p>Although there were only two lectures, I felt both were engaging and informative. 
             Since Downing calls on individual people in class, it really keeps you alert and active during the lectures. As for the first quiz, I got a 5/5, which is a nice start. 
             Hopefully, I can keep that up. <p>
          <h4> 6.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
          <p>My pick of the week is Bootstrap. 
             It is a framework, used for front-end web development.
             If you want to make website, I think Boostrap offers a nice template to start off without overwhelming yourself.
             After using their code, you can really digest and learn how does HTML and front-end work. 
             For those who learn programming languages through code examples, Bootstrap was really helpful for me. Plus, I got my own website at the end. </p>

          <p> Here's a their "Getting Stared" Page. <a href ="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/</a></p>
          
          <p> Then here's their "Components" page, which lists all the things you can do with Bootstrap. <a href ="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/</a></p>

<p>I hope people find it as useful as I did when making a website.</p>
