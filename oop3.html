	      <h3>Week of 29 Jan - Feb 3 Post 1</h3>
	      <p>Here's my third blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>This past week, I spent the majoirty of my time trying to recover from last week's illness.
           Thankfully it's much better, but I'm still coughing and congested, making it harder to finish assignments and homework. 
          I barely finish my algo homework and Collatz, the two biggest assignments I had this week. 
          And I just realized, I forgot to show proofs for one question from the algo homework.
          Hopefully, next week will be much better. 
          The doctor did say that the coughing and the congestion should go away by Sunday. 
        </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>I'm still trying to catch up on some last week's work, that was put off from my cold.
          Thankfully the big assignments are done, the only thing left to do officer work,
           like paperwork, emails, and budget plans, for one of my sports club. 
           With a big national competition coming soon, there's a big financial slog to get through. 
           Besides booking the hotels and buying plane tickets, there's still fundraising that needs to get done. 
           In the past, we haven't had much success, at most raised around $300. 
           Which doesn't seem bad, but when total cost for the trip can go over $2000, we need to raise more. 
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>Besides officer tasks, I will need to do my algo homework, 
          competitive assignment, and, possibily, the second OOP project.
          After last week, I really want to start these tasks early. 
          Starting the competitive assingment the date it was due was not a good idea. 
          Moreover, this week I need to redo my resume and some of my side projects. 
          While not terrible, I realized they could be better. 
          So my goal is to finish them by Wednesday or Thursday. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) Whatâ€™s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>I really like the in-class HackerRank problems. 
          They help clarify and internalizes how and why does C++ work the way it does, 
          such as the pre-increment and post-increment.
          Before, I didn't understand why these two increments were different. 
          Thus, I could never remember which one does what.
          After doing the HackerRank problem, I finally understood why one
          returns a copy and the other doesn't.
          I hope we do more of these in the future. 
        <p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick-of-the-week is this Competitve Programming Handbook. 
           It has over 30 chapters, talking about graph alogrithms to dynamtic programming.
           Moreover, this book contains code, so that you can learn how to 
           implement the algorithms.
           Although this book is used for competitive, it is still really useful 
           for interviews. I highly recommend this to anyone. 
           Currently, I think the writer is trying to publish or finalize the book.
           You can still get a free draft of the book. </p>
        <p>You can download the draft of the book here. <a href = "https://cses.fi/book.pdf">Click here</a></p>
