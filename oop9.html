        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 5 Mar - 11 Mar Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my eighth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>Didn’t really do much this week, other than the algo assignment and Allocator project. For me, I felt this last project was more time consuming than the previous two. My partner and I encountered several errors, that took us a long time to debug. One annoying bug was the “stack smashing” error. I think its actually name is “stack buffer overflow,” but HackerRank called it “stack smashing error” so that’s what I will call it for now (plus stack smashing sounds much cooler than stack buffer overflow). Regardless, we found the error was in our constructor, when we were setting the end centennial. Here we indexed into the array wrong, thus causing the bug. 
        </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>
          Next week, I have a a gov exam on Thursday night. Then the week after, I have an algo and religious studies exam. The gov and religious studies one doesn’t sound too bad, but I am still a bit worried. I am confident I can pass, but I want an A in both classes. So trying to get A’s on the exams has me a bit concern. As for algo, I’m just expecting death. Hopefully it is a swift one.  
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>For next week, I plan to start studying for the upcoming algo exam and the two other exams. This past week, I did not run very often due to being busy with assignments and projects. Hopefully next week I can run more often, especially since I have more free time. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>In class we talked about the vector class. It is cool to learn how the vector class is built and run on C++. I’m curious on how in-depth we will talk about it. It seems quite similar to the RangeIterator class that we disused about a few weeks ago. 
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My tip-of-the-week is having a calendar or planner. Whether it is a digital one or not, I found them useful in being organized. Moreover, it visually illustrates what events you have in the upcoming weeks. Before, I used a physical planner. While it was good, I recently switched to Google Calendar. I found the digital one super convenient in scheduling and planning events, especially when they’re constantly changing. Though I am not sure how comfortable I am, now that Google knows what I’m doing every second of my day.
