        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 5 Mar - 11 Mar Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my eighth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>This past week I spent most of it studying for my religious studies quiz. Unlike normal quizzes that I have taken, this one little quiz was worth 10% of our grade, which is quite a lot. Since we haven’t done much in the class, we didn’t know how the professor would structure the quiz itself. Thankfully, the quiz itself wasn’t too bad. Then after the quiz, I finished my algo assignment. But other than towards two, there was not any big events this week. I guess one big thing is that I think I slept, in total, about 6 hours in the GDC this past week. That’s a new record for me.  </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>
          This spring break, there’s a lot school work I could get done, like OOP’s Allocator project, algo assignment, and religious studies readings. However knowing myself, I doubt I would get much done, maybe parts of the allocator project. Still it’s best to something done, so I don’t have to cram everything the week we get back. 
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>Currently, I am visiting my mom in Huntsville, AL. Before coming, I didn’t know much about the area other than a lot of NASA employers are there. Now after spending a day here, I realized the countryside isn’t for me. Too much driving. Still a cool place to work in, especially if you work for NASA (They have a cool space museum). But the constant driving everywhere is starting to get to me. Why can’t we just move the stores closer together so we can just walk there? Please. How hard can it be to take everything and push it closer together?
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>I like how Downing talks about the project in class. It helps clear some confusion that me and my partner had when we started Allocator.
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My tip of the week is to make the most of your spring break. I do not mean just finishing or catching up on all your school work. I having fun doing stuff than just sitting around the house. I don’t know how it is to other people, but I found my break is more refreshing and relaxing when I spent it doing more adventitious stuff.
