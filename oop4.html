        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
	      <h3>Week of 5 Feb - 11 Feb Post </h3>
	      <p>Here's my fourth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>This week I participate in my first competitive programming competition.
          I have to say it was a lot of fun. My team and I were able to solve four out 
          of maybe eight or nice problems (can’t remember the exact number). 
          I am a bit disappointed that I didn’t prepare for graph problems that much, 
          because a good third of the problems were graphs. In the end, I had fun, 
          learn a lot, and got free food. </p>
        <p>
          After the competition, I watch the Winter Olympics opening ceremony with my friends. 
          I got to say those drones and the fireworks were breathtaking. Though, we think we spot one 
          drone that missed its mark: it flew off in the opposite direction as the other drones. 
          Maybe it got hacked because the Intel made the drones. Still, the Parade of Nations was just 
          so wholesome, seeing all the athletes happy, enjoying their time. 
          I still can’t believe that Tongan let the shirtless guy from Rio carry the flag in the dead 
          of winter. </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>This Thursday I have my  first gov. exam, shouldn’t be too hard. 
          Social studies is one of my strongest subject and I been doing well on the quizzes. 
          So I’m confident I can do well. Though, algo is a different story. 
          I have the first exam in about a week, and been doing alright on the quizzes and homework.
          Still, I need to really buckle down and study for this upcoming exam. 
 
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>As mention before, I really need to study for the algo exam. 
          Additionally, my sports club just finished finalizing our travel budget. 
          Now the only thing left to do is buy plane tickets, which is sadly quite expensive. 

          Besides that, there’s still Career Fair prep. 
          I’m hoping to do better than my previous attempts at Career Fair. 
          As I’m a bit shy when talking to recruiters, 
          I think practicing for a week on what to say will really help me. 

        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>So far, I been a bit confused on the l-values and r-values. 
          The recent quiz did clear up some confusion, but I’m still puzzled on 
          the little intricacies and differences between the two. 
          Maybe if I experience with them a bit, that will help clear my head.

        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick-of-the-week are these two articles on the 1,218 drones used in the Winter Olympics. 
           Although they do not detailed exatly how the drones would programmed, 
           they do explain how they asked for animators to help create the 3D snowboarder.
           I think it’s cool that other disciplines, like animation, collaborated with programmers to 
           create something speculator. </p>
