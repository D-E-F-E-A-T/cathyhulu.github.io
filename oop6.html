        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 19 Feb - 25 Feb Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my sixth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>The beginning of the week was heavily focused on the algo exam and Career Fair.
         Both were okay: could have prepared better. On the happier side of things, 
         one of my friends wanted me to prepare him for LonghornRun, 
         due to my background of running 5Ks, so I agreed to help. 
         We started on Wednesday, and I have been killing him ever sense. 
         Just kidding. 
         I didn’t actually kill him, but I have been encouraging him to push himself more.
         Like all sports, long-distance running requires great discipline to get better.
         So far, he’s been doing a good job. Hopefully, he keeps it up.</p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>
          So far this week has mostly been the same workload to do: school, officer stuff,
          side projects, and internship hunting. 
          Though, I have been doing more interview prep, like practicing on leetcode and hackerrank. 
          Thankfully, doing the competitive programing assignments gives extra practice.
          Another task I have been doing is creating a training regime for my above friend.
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>Thankfully, most of my exams finished this or last week. 
          So the only big thing I have is the OOP exam, which I will be studying for.
          Another big thing is doubling my interview prep, since interview season has
          basically started, especially with the recent Career Fair event. 
          Hopefully, I can find internship this year. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>So far I been doing better on quizzes, which is good. 
          Though the material has been getting more complicated, 
          which may be foreshadowing a drop in my quiz grades. 
          Hopefully, this doesn’t happen. 
          Regardless, this only means I need to spend more time reviewing the material
          after class and double-checking that I understand the concepts. 
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick of the week is Leetcode. 
        This website is similar to HackerRank, but I feel the problems are much harder,
        which is great for interviews. 
        If you’re still looking for internships or tech jobs, 
        I highly recommend this website to practice. 
        It really challenges you. 
        If Leetcode is not enough, maybe you could try some competitive programming
        websites, that I discovered from the taking the class: 
        Codeforces, CodeWars, TopCoder, CodeChef, Project Euler and SPOJ. 
        Though, these are more contest-oriented but still great practice.</p>
