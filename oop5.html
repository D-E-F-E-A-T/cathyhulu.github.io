        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
	      <h3>Week of 12 Feb - 18 Feb Post </h3>
	      <p>Here's my fifth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>This week I went to the opening night of Black Panther. 
          Although it’s not my most favorite Marvel movie, it was still an engaging and great film. 
          I don’t want to spoil the movie too much, so I will try to keep my thoughts too a minimum. 
          Still, Wakanda was so fascinating. It was filled with many little details that makes the world 
          and the people who inhabit it, real. 
          Also, the actors themselves did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. 
          I almost wish that T’Challa was real. 
          Though I got to say that one shouldn’t watch this movie right after taking a gov. exam, 
          especially one that focuses on international politics. 
          Throughout the film, I keep thinking about the stuff I just studied for, 
          kind of takes you out of the film for awhile. </p>

        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>The two biggest events I have is the algo exam and Career Fair. 
          I’m scared for both them and don’t feel really prepared.</p>

        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>I will definitely be studying and preparing for my algo exam and Career Fair.
          Thankfully I will be finish with both of them by Tuesday, 
          which means I can spend my time watching the Winter Olympics. 
          Though I am bit sad that the Olympics will end in a week. 
          Yet again, this means the Paralympics are one step closer 
          (the opening ceremony is on March 8 Thursday).  </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>This past week,  it seems we been learning a lot new intricacies of C++, 
          such as const pointers, arrays, and iterators. 
          Since it’s a lot of new information, I really have to study and review what we 
          learned the previous day in order to keep up. 
          Although the quizzes  are hard, they are helpful in determining whether I
           truly understand the material or not. 
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick-of-the-week are this video and article about the special effects used in the Marvel movies, 
          partially the ones used for Civil War Black Panther. 
          After watching the video, I’m shock by the amount of CGI was used. 
          Even for shots we thought contained real objects, instead was CGI. 

          As for the article itself, it doesn’t contain much but a list of all the special effects studios used in making the Black Panther movie. 
          Here, I’m fascinated that 10 studios was used to create one 2 hour movie. 
          It makes me wonder about the intense coordination and communication it was required between all those studios. </p>
