        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 9 Apr - 15 Apr Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my twelfth blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>The majority of my time was spent on working on OOP. Classes has been picking up lately. With only two-to-three-ish weeks of classes left, I don’t want to fall behind.  Sadly this week, I missed some classes due to doctors appointment or interviews. Now, I’m feeling like I am behind.  </p>

        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>Next week seems like another busy week for me. I have an algo assignment and an OOP project due. Then on Sunday, I have a budget presentation for one of my clubs. Here, we have to convince the RecSports officials to allocate money to our club. Hopefully, it will go well. I’m a bit scared because this year we went to more out-of-state competitions than previous years. So our plan is to operate on a loss this year. Then next year we will work harder to make up the money. I just hope RecSports will give us money to continue operating as a sponsored org.  </p>

        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>Next week I will finish my major school assignments, the algo assignment and OOP project. Then I will try to start studying for finals, since it will be about two weeks before the exams. On Friday, is when I will register. Hopefully, I can get into the classes I want to. </p>

        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>The Life project has been going okay. My partner and I encountered a timeout on last test for Fredkin. After hours of optimization attempts using queues, we decided to try to do the brute force way of just checking all the elements in the 2D vector grid. Turns out the brute force way was faster. We think this is because we have queues of pairs. Then every time we push onto the queue, we have to make a pair structure. This could pair constructing could slow us down. </p>

        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick-of-the-week is kanopy.com. It’s a website similar to Netflix, except it mostly has documentaries, critical-acclaim films, and world cinema. As a huge movie bluff, I love being able to watch the old black-and-white talkies, foreign films, and the unknown indies. Besides that, they have lots of documentaries on a range of topics, including technology and computer science. But the best of all, this website is completely free with our UT ID. </p>
        <p> If you have time, you should check this out. Lots of free movies and documentaries for you to watch. </p>
