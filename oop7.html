        <h1>CS 371p Spring 2018: Catherine Lu</h1>
        <h3>Week of 26 Feb - 4 Mar Post </h3>
        <p>Here's my seventh blog post. </p>
        <h4>1.) What did you do this past week? </h4>
        <p>For school, I spent most of my time in preparation of the OOP exam. Then on Saturday, I volunteered for CS Roadshow at Explore UT. It was quite fun hanging out with kids. Turns out, I wasn’t as bad with kids as I thought I was. One kid remarked about our Raspberry Pi demo that it “tasted nasty.” Thankfully, he didn’t actually lick the Pi but still quite amusing about the confusion between our demo and the food item. Other funny instances was a scavenger hunt, which the solution was “CS is cool.” While some kids solve the hunt, others gave some interesting answers, like “UT is cool,” “CS is good,” and “it is cool.” </p>
        <h4>2.) What's in your way?</h4>
        <p>
          Thankfully the big stuff is over. Now the only thing left is a religious studies quiz on Tuesday. Hopefully, it won’t be too hard. Other stuff include interview prep, like practicing for the behavior and technical interviews, and finishing some side projects. A friend and I started working a project that analyze data on several short track speed skating competitions. We’re still learning basic tools, but it’s been fun.
        </p>
        <h4>3.) What will you do next week?</h4>
        <p>There’s seems to be quite a lot of tasks that needs to get done: doing interview prep, creating asset designs for ISSS, training my friend for Longhorn Run, studying for my religious studies quiz, and finishing my algo homework. It’s a good thing spring break is coming. I could use a nice week-long break. Though month break would be even better. Sometimes I feel I still haven’t fully recovered after OS last semester. 
        </p>
        <h4>4.) What’s my experience of the class? </h4>
        <p>So far the class has been interesting and meretricious, which is very helpful when learning a new programming language. I already been applying the stuff I learn for some C++ projects. I cannot wait to apply this even more in future classes, like Graphics, or projects. 
        </p>
        <h4>5.) What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h4>
        <p>My pick-of-the-week is SoloLearn playground. The website has lots of great and interactive tutorials for a variety of languages, like Python 3, JavaScript, and SQL. Though I admit I haven’t done any of their tutorials, but some of my friends highly recommend it. Instead, I will talk about its playground. It’s like a simple IDE-with-terminal-thingy. But I found it really helpful when preparing for the recent exam. Here, I can easier and quicker test certain aspects of C++ without the hassle of creating a C++ file and running it. Even better, the playground can run not just C++, but a whole variety of languages.
